# How to publish changes to developers.alcmeon.com
When you have finished to write code you need to run the _validate.sh_ script, which checks the syntax of your changes; if everything is good you’ll be able to push it and the code will be published **automatically** on the doc.

N.B.: You can also push without having run this script but, in that casem nothing will happen.
